# FamilyQuiz
Simple Java family quarantine quiz game, with split/steal and scategories.

Created during the 2020 lock down with a view to practice Java GUI development. 
This project is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination as it is one of my very first independent Java projects.
In-fact, it was initially developed in BlueJ.

The game has hard coded player names, as it was intended for members of my family and not general purpose. 

There are multiple windows, including wild cards, a scategories section and split/steal where teams could split or steal points from other players.
